# Kill Bill go client library

This is a basic implementation of a client library written in go to interract with Kill Bill.

The http layer has been adapated from the existing [napping](https://github.com/jmcvetta/napping) go repository (which was itself inspired by Python's excellent [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) library.

# Status

Only a few APIs have been implemented so far, mostly around payments call. There is an example which using go concurrency feature to throw some load at an existing running Kill Bill instance.
